        <h1>Blood Report Analysis: Importance & Effects of Abnormal Levels</h1>
        
        <p><strong>Kidney Function:</strong> Creatinine is a waste product from muscle metabolism, and its levels indicate kidney function. High creatinine levels may suggest kidney disease, dehydration, or muscle breakdown. Low levels can indicate muscle loss, malnutrition, or liver disease. GFR (Estimated) measures how well the kidneys filter waste. A low GFR is a sign of kidney disease, dehydration, or heart failure. A high GFR is usually not a concern unless extremely high, which can indicate early diabetes-related kidney issues. Urea / Urea Nitrogen (Blood) reflects protein metabolism and kidney function. High levels may result from kidney disease, dehydration, or a high-protein diet. Low levels can be caused by liver disease, malnutrition, or overhydration. Uric Acid is a waste product from purine metabolism. High uric acid levels may lead to gout, kidney stones, or high-purine diets. Low levels could indicate liver disease, certain medications, or kidney issues.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Liver Function:</strong> AST (SGOT) is an enzyme found in the liver, heart, and muscles. High AST levels may indicate liver damage, muscle injury, or a heart attack. Low levels are not usually concerning. ALT (SGPT) is primarily a liver enzyme. High ALT levels suggest liver damage, hepatitis, or fatty liver disease. Low levels are rarely a medical concern. GGTP helps detect liver and bile duct diseases. High GGTP levels can be caused by liver disease, alcohol abuse, or bile duct obstruction. Low levels are not typically problematic. ALP (Alkaline Phosphatase) is an enzyme that reflects liver, bone, and bile duct function. High levels may indicate liver disease, bone disorders, or bile duct blockage. Low levels may result from nutritional deficiencies or hypothyroidism. Bilirubin (Total) is a waste product from the breakdown of red blood cells and is an indicator of liver function. High bilirubin levels can cause jaundice and suggest liver disease or bile duct obstruction. Low levels are usually not a concern.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Protein Levels:</strong> Total Protein measures overall protein levels in the blood. High levels can indicate chronic inflammation or infections. Low levels may suggest malnutrition, liver disease, or kidney issues. Albumin is a protein that helps maintain fluid balance and transport nutrients. High albumin levels are typically due to dehydration. Low levels can be caused by liver disease, kidney disease, or malnutrition. Globulin is a protein involved in immune function. High levels may indicate chronic infections or inflammation. Low levels could point to immune deficiencies or liver disease.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Electrolytes & Minerals:</strong> Calcium (Total) is essential for bone, nerve, and muscle function. High calcium levels may indicate overactive parathyroid glands, cancer, or excess vitamin D intake. Low calcium can result from vitamin D deficiency, kidney disease, or hypoparathyroidism. Phosphorus plays a crucial role in bone and cell function. High phosphorus levels may result from kidney disease or excessive intake. Low phosphorus can be due to malnutrition, alcohol abuse, or hyperparathyroidism. Sodium is important for fluid balance and nerve function. High sodium levels can be caused by dehydration, kidney disease, or excessive salt intake. Low sodium levels may result from excess fluid retention, kidney issues, or adrenal insufficiency. Potassium is critical for heart and muscle function. High potassium levels may indicate kidney disease or excessive intake. Low potassium levels can be caused by diuretics, malnutrition, or hormonal imbalances. Chloride helps maintain fluid balance and acid-base levels. High chloride levels are linked to dehydration and kidney disease. Low levels can be caused by vomiting, dehydration, or adrenal disorders.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Lipid Profile:</strong> Total Cholesterol is necessary for cell function but must be balanced. High cholesterol increases the risk of heart disease and arterial blockages. Low cholesterol may result from malnutrition or hyperthyroidism. Triglycerides are stored fats in the body. High triglyceride levels are associated with obesity, diabetes, and excessive alcohol consumption. Low levels may indicate malnutrition or hyperthyroidism. HDL ("Good" Cholesterol) helps remove bad cholesterol from arteries. High HDL is usually beneficial but, in rare cases, very high levels may indicate underlying health concerns. Low HDL levels increase the risk of heart disease. LDL ("Bad" Cholesterol) contributes to artery blockages. High LDL levels are linked to heart disease and stroke risk. Low LDL levels can be associated with hyperthyroidism or malnutrition. Non-HDL Cholesterol includes all harmful cholesterol types. High levels indicate a higher risk of heart disease, while low levels are generally not a concern.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Glucose Test:</strong> Glucose Fasting measures blood sugar levels. High fasting glucose levels indicate diabetes, stress, or hormonal imbalance. Low glucose levels can be due to hypoglycemia or adrenal insufficiency.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Vitamin Tests:</strong> Vitamin B12 is crucial for nerve function and red blood cell production. High levels are rarely harmful but may indicate liver disease. Low levels can lead to anemia, nerve damage, and fatigue. Vitamin D is essential for bone health and immunity. High vitamin D levels can cause toxicity and kidney damage. Low levels can weaken bones and the immune system.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Thyroid Profile:</strong> T3 (Total) regulates metabolism. High T3 levels can cause hyperthyroidism, weight loss, and anxiety. Low T3 levels indicate hypothyroidism, leading to weight gain and fatigue. T4 (Total) is another thyroid hormone responsible for metabolism regulation. High T4 levels are linked to hyperthyroidism. Low levels indicate hypothyroidism and a slower metabolism. TSH controls thyroid hormone production. High TSH suggests hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). Low TSH indicates hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid).</p>
        
        <p><strong>Diabetes Marker:</strong> HbA1c measures long-term blood sugar control. High levels indicate poor glucose management and diabetes. Low levels suggest hypoglycemia or adrenal insufficiency.</p>
